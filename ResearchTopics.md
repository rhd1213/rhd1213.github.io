<dt>Structural Health Self-monitoring (SHSm) </dt>
<dd>Continuous carbon fiber reinforced plastics <br>
  with a function of mechanical deformation monitoring without any sensors. </dd>

<dt>Artificial Intelligence (AI) to Composites </dt>
<dd>State-of-the-art technologies for <br>
  not only composite manufacturing but also functionalizations such as SHSm algorithms. </dd>

<dt>Composite Joining (Planned) </dt>
<dd>Any joining methods are considered such as laser, sonicator, and induction. <br> 
    This topic is under contemplation (TBD). </dd>
